In the present directory four scripts are contained which have been used to download and prepare the ERA5 data to obtain monthly SPI and SPEI data per 
administrative unit and ethnic group territory:
1. 01_ERA5_download.py downloads needed hourly ERA5 data
2. 02_ERA5_ToDailyResolution.ipynb aggregates the data to daily resolution
3. 03_PenmanMonteith.ipynb calculates the reference evapotranspiration from daily meteorological data and elevation data
4. 04_SPI_SPEI.ipynb computes SPI and SPEI (aggregation periods: 1, 3, 6 and 12 months) at gridded level for each month and subsequently calculates spatial
   statistics per admin-1 level and ethnic group territory
