The directory contains three scripts for analysing and preprocessing the conflict data from UCDP-GED.

1. 01_ConflictDataAnalysis_Kenya.ipynb has been the base for the data processing steps. It analyses the data structure, issues with temporal and spatial precision codes and the different conflict types in Kenya and the study area.
2. 02_ConflictDataPreprocessing_HoA.ipynb retrieves monthly event count and binary conflict occurrence variables for each admin-1 level in the wider study area (Kenya, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda) and for the dominant conflicting ethnic groups in North-Western Kenya.
